# -2048-game
A simple implementation of the 2048 game using Python and Tkinter
The objective of the project is to develop a 2048 game using python tkinter.
In this game, we have to press any one of four keys to move up, down, left, or right. 
When we press a key, the elements move in the direction of the respective key and if any two same numbers are in that same row or column they get added up.
To develop this game we need a basic knowledge of this game and some models like tkinter, random and configparser.
tkinter – for use Interface(UI)
random – to generate random values.
Below is the structure of python 2048 game:
1.Importing modules
2.Creating display function
3.Define Function
4.Creating main function
